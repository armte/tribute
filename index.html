     <h2 class="text-center">About</h2>
     <p style="text-align: left;">Nikola Tesla was born in Smijlan, at the time a city in the Austrian Empire, present-day Croatia. He was the son of an orthodox priest and grew up in a very traditional and religious environment. Along with that up-bringing he received a complete and thorough education. His physics professor in high school first sparked his interest in electricty. This was followed by intense and relentless study of magnetism and electric currents during his time in University. He excelled in the subjects and devised a new system to deliver electricty that would later be known as AC current.<img class="img-responsive young-tesla" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/N.Tesla.JPG/220px-N.Tesla.JPG" alt="A young Nikola Tesla"> He took his idea to the United States where his invention of AC current was realized and soon applied to cities throughout the world, exemplifying it's efficiency and supremacy over Thomas Edison's DC electrical current systems. The night no longer meant darkness thanks to Tesla with cities now illuminated under electric lights delivered by AC current. Tesla is most well-known for inventing AC current but he also devised many other inventions. He played a major part in the development of radio, coming up with a patent years before Marconi. Whatever he is remembered for he will always be remembered as one of the most influential minds of his time and one that has had a lasting impact on the world.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left;"><b>July 10, 1856:</b> Nikola Tesla is born in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern day Croatia)<br><br><b>1870:</b> Tesla moves to Karlovac to attend high school. It's here that he becomes interested in electricity from demonstrations by his physics professor<br><br><b>1873: </b>Tesla moves back to Smiljan and shortly after contracts Cholera. At certain points throughout his illness he was not expected to survive. It might have been at one of these moments where his father promised to send him to the best engineering school if he survived. <br><br><b>1875: </b>Tesla enrolls at Austrain Polytechnic in Graz, Austria. Despite initially excelling at the school he soon let his proclivity for gambling prevent him from graduating.<br><br><b>March, 1879:</b> Tesla's father dies<br><br><b>1881: </b>Tesla moves to Budapest, Hungary to begin working for The Budapest Telephone Exchange, a telegraph company.<br><br><b>1882: </b>Tesla begins working at a subdivision of the Continental Edison Company installing public incandescent lighting throughout cities in France. Through his work, he quickly advances in his knowledge of electrical engineering. Upper management notices his aptitude and has him start developing new eletrical generators and motors.<br><br><b>1884: </b>The Edison Company moves Tesla's manager back to New York City and Tesla is brought by his manager to New York City to continue working with him.<br><br><b>January, 4th 1885: </b>Tesla leaves The Edison Company. The reason for his leaving remains unclear but it seems that unpaid bonuses could have been the reason for his resignation.<br><br><b>April 1887: </b>With Alfred Brown and Charles Peck, Tesla forms the Tesla Electric Company.<br><br><b>May, 1888: </b>Tesla patents his induction motor that runs on AC current and much more efficient than the current DC motors.<br><br><b>July, 1888: </b>Tesla makes a deal with Westinghouse Electric giving them license to his AC induction motor. This earns Tesla financial independence and freedom to continue developing inventions in electricty.<br><br><b>July 30th, 1891: </b>Tesla patents the Tesla Coil and becomes a U.S. citizen<br><br><b>1893: </b>Tesla collaborates with Westinghouse Electric in an electric exhibition running on AC power at the World's Columbian Exposition. This is a turning point in AC electric systems as it showed the public the efficiency, safety and reliability of AC power.<br><br><b>1896: </b>Conducts experiments in x-ray imaging.<br><br><b>1899: </b>Tesla sets up an experimental station in Colorado Springs to continue investigating the conductivity of low pressure air.</p>

He plans to beat out Marconi's design for the transmission of radio waves with his tower but fails when Marconi sends and receives the first radio waves with his system in December of 1901.<br><br><b>1915: </b>Wardenclyffe is foreclosed after Tesla fails to gain more funding in his work<br><br><b>January 7th, 1943: </b>Tesla dies alone in his room at the New Yorker Hotel at the age of 86.<br><br>
